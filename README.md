# ðŸš€ Rocketâ€¯10

A minimalist Windows 10 remix that launches your perfect system from PowerShell and winget.

## Usage

1. Get a windows installation iso of your choice. (Windows 10 Enterprise or IoT Enterprise highly recommended)
2. Create a usb installation medium using Rufus or a comparable software product (If you want or need a virtual medium, create and attach a vhdx. Rufus will write to it.)
3. Run *rocket10.py* (todo : explain or automate pipenv ceremony)
4. Use installation medium.
5. Use *PowerShell* and *winget* on the new device to setup the exact system you need.
